# 📌 Python Project 🐍

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've developed while learning Python. Each project is a step forward in my journey of mastering Python programming.

## Projects 🚀

1. **Calculator 🧮:** This Python script provides a simple calculator that allows user to perform various mathematical operations. You can choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, exponentiation, square root, and factorial. The program uses a command-line interface for user interaction.

1. **Youtube Manager 🎥:**

- The first Python script allows you to manage a list of YouTube videos. You can list all videos, add a new video with its name and duration, update the details of an existing video, and delete a video. Video details are stored in a file named `youtube.txt` as JSON format. The program provides a simple command-line interface for these operations.

- The second Python script uses SQLite to manage a list of YouTube videos. It allows you to list all videos, add new videos with their names, durations, and links, update the details of existing videos, and delete videos. Video details are stored in a SQLite database named `youtube_videos.db`. The program provides a simple command-line interface for these operations.
