# Random Quote Fetcher üìù‚ú®

Welcome to the Random Quote Fetcher project! This Python script fetches random quotes from the FreeAPI and displays them in the console. It's a fun way to get inspired by random quotes!

## How It Works üîß

The script uses the `requests` library to make an API call to the FreeAPI to fetch a random quote. The quote and its author are then displayed in the console. You can choose to fetch another quote or exit the program.

## Code Explanation üßê

### `fetch_random_quotes()` Function

This function fetches a random quote from the FreeAPI.

- The function sends a GET request to the API endpoint.

- It parses the JSON response to extract the quote and its author.

- If the request is successful, it returns the quote and author. Otherwise, it raises an exception.

### `main()` Function

This function manages the flow of the program, allowing the user to fetch multiple quotes or exit.

- It enters an infinite loop to continually fetch quotes until the user decides to stop.

- It handles exceptions that may occur during the API call.

- It prompts the user to fetch another quote or exit.
